Data analysis on covid-19 and US Presidential Election Results

Is there a correlation between partisanship and Covid numbers?

## Datasets

![US Presidential Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-20/master/2020_US_County_Level_Presidential_Results.csv)
![CDC County Level Vaccination Data](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/)
![HHS County Level ICU Capacity Data](https://healthdata.gov/resource/anag-cw7u.csv)

There are instructions at the top of the notebook if you want to download and run the data yourself.

## Results

![Final Graph](https://github.com/TimOgden/CoVID/blob/main/final_graph.jpg)

This graph shows both vaccination rates and ICU capacities over time with events labeled, but the country is stratified into n different sets determined by political leaning in the 2020 election. In this case, n=6.
